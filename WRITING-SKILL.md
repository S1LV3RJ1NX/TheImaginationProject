Title: Best Skill to Learn in 2026 (AI Can't Replace This)

(0:00) Most people think

(0:02) writing is about expressing themselves.

(0:05) You have a thought, an idea, a feeling

(0:08) and they want to put it into words.

(0:11) In my opinion, this is the starting

(0:14) point for almost all bad writing.

(0:19) In this video, I'm not going to cover

(0:21) syntax or which word comes after which.

(0:23) You can figure that out yourself. But

(0:25) I'm going to cover the substance, not

(0:26) the style. This video is about the

(0:29) secrets of good writing. It's about the

(0:31) underlying structure of how you can

(0:33) communicate and persuade people. And

(0:35) it's also the unspoken rules that govern

(0:37) how ideas are accepted or rejected.

(0:40) There's a pattern to it. From this point

(0:41) on, we're not going to care so much

(0:43) about what you want to say, but we want

(0:45) to care about what people hear.

(0:56) I think the red pill truth about writing

(0:58) is that it has almost nothing to do with

(1:00) you the writer. Effective writing is not

(1:03) an act of self-expression. It has a

(1:05) little bit in it but it's not primarily

(1:06) that. It is an act of applied

(1:08) psychology. It's a kind of specific

(1:12) desired experience in the mind of

(1:13) another person that you are engineering.

(1:16) The words are not the point. The effect

(1:18) the words have on the reader is the

(1:20) point. Most people are focusing on the

(1:22) syntax and the words because of the

(1:23) transmission. But the masters of this

(1:26) craft focus on the reception. This is

(1:28) why a software engineer named Som Parik

(1:31) was able to get hundreds of interviews

(1:32) while most people can't even get one.

(1:34) Recently, a scandal erupted in the

(1:36) startup world. There was a software

(1:38) engineer named Som Parik who was accused

(1:40) of moonlighting by working for three or

(1:42) four different startups at the same

(1:43) time, deceiving them all. As founders

(1:46) compared notes, they discovered he had

(1:48) used nearly identical cold emails just

(1:51) to get started. It wasn't because he was

(1:53) necessarily the best engineer, but he

(1:55) was pretty good. It was because he wrote

(1:57) a damn good cold email. And that email

(2:00) wasn't good because it expressed who he

(2:02) was. It was good because it perfectly

(2:04) understood who he was writing to. He was

(2:07) not really just looking to send a

(2:08) message. He's kind of like executing a

(2:11) program in the mind of his target

(2:12) audience. While the ethics of his

(2:14) employment were debated, I'm sure

(2:16) everyone has their own viewpoints. A

(2:17) different conversation started bubbling

(2:19) up, right? Which is the email itself was

(2:21) a work of genius. It's not genius in the

(2:24) sense that it had some crazy words and

(2:26) writing. It was genius in a

(2:27) psychological sense and I want to

(2:30) deconstruct it.

(2:33) So the emails that Parik sent to various

(2:35) founders had a very precise template.

(2:38) Here's the core of it. Hey, I love

(2:40) everything about what company name is

(2:42) doing. I don't have many hobbies outside

(2:44) coding. I'm not athletic, bad at

(2:46) singing, don't drink, can't dance.

(2:47) Building is the only thing I'm good at.

(2:49) He would then list his technical skills,

(2:51) mentioning his experience in super lean

(2:53) teams and his ability to work across the

(2:56) stack. See, on the surface, this looks

(2:57) like a decent, you know, application.

(3:00) But that's the blue pill reading. The

(3:02) red pill reading shows that every line

(3:04) is carefully calibrated. It's like a

(3:06) psychological program that is running in

(3:08) their brains, especially in the brain of

(3:10) a startup founder. Think about it. I

(3:12) love everything about what company name

(3:14) is doing. That's not flattery. Flattery

(3:16) is generic. He's taken the time to

(3:18) mention the company's name for starters.

(3:20) Most people don't even mention company

(3:21) name. In a world of generic copypasted

(3:23) applications, the minute this line

(3:26) exists, it signals that he's done his

(3:28) homework. And it immediately shifts the

(3:29) conversation from what he wants to what

(3:31) the owner of the company wants. The next

(3:33) line is brilliant. I don't have many

(3:35) hobbies outside coding. Building is the

(3:36) only thing I'm good at. This is a master

(3:38) stroke. It's not saying that oh I'm

(3:40) awkward I don't know how to hang out

(3:42) with other people. It's just it's not

(3:44) any of that. It's a sign that look at me

(3:46) I'm so focused. Startup culture

(3:48) particularly the you know the Y

(3:49) cominator guys fetishizes the relentless

(3:52) resourceful founder and the engineer who

(3:54) lives and breathes code. It's kind of

(3:56) like a meme now right and this sentence

(3:57) is a very quick way of so I'm saying I

(4:00) am the ideal engineer you dream of

(4:02) hiring. It's the cracked engineer you

(4:04) read all about on Twitter right? I have

(4:05) no distractions. I will not be looking

(4:07) for work life balance. I only build.

(4:09) It's a form of you know kind of putting

(4:11) him making himself look bad by saying I

(4:13) don't have hobbies this that. But same

(4:16) time he's boasting about his traits the

(4:18) audience values the most. And next he's

(4:20) saying being part of super lean teams

(4:22) one of my strongest suites has been the

(4:24) ability to work across the stack. Here

(4:26) he's using what we like to call in-group

(4:28) language. Words like super lean teams

(4:30) and work across the stack are not like

(4:32) normal words that most people would use

(4:33) in their application. He's signaling

(4:35) that I belong. I know your words. All

(4:37) these YC companies, they they use a

(4:39) bunch of lingo, right? They have a

(4:40) language in their world. And he's saying

(4:41) that look, I'm part of the group. I know

(4:43) the language. I'm a member of the tribe.

(4:46) Now, to understand why this worked, you

(4:47) must first understand the audience. Who

(4:49) is a startup founder? A startup founder

(4:51) is not a corporate hiring manager.

(4:52) They're not optimizing for any process

(4:53) or something. They're optimizing for a

(4:55) word called conviction. How much do I

(4:57) believe in this? Their world is defined

(4:59) by, you know, there's a very famous

(5:00) line, right? Missionaries, not

(5:02) mercenaries. Missionaries are people who

(5:03) really believe in the mission.

(5:04) Mercenaries are people who go out, you

(5:06) know, collect a bounty for everything

(5:07) that they do, right? Their greatest hope

(5:09) as a startup founder is to find someone

(5:11) as obsessed with their company as they

(5:13) are. This parex email was not, you know,

(5:15) just some skills that he was listing

(5:16) like most of you do. It was a mirror to

(5:18) show a founder.

(5:20) It's their deepest desire of the founder

(5:22) reflected back at them. And I think this

(5:24) is crazy audience analysis, right? Who

(5:26) cares about technical needs? In the real

(5:27) world, you'll realize all those things

(5:29) are backseat. Psychological needs are

(5:31) more important. That email was so

(5:32) effective. It didn't just ask for a job.

(5:34) It's saying founder, your worldview is

(5:36) correct. These are the kind of employees

(5:37) you should be looking for. I am one of

(5:39) them. So the core belief of a founder is

(5:41) their mission is so compelling, so good,

(5:43) such a grand vision that should attract

(5:45) exceptional obsessive talent. And Parx

(5:47) email comes in and says, "You are right.

(5:49) You are exactly right. You amazing,

(5:52) right? People like me do exist and your

(5:54) company is one of the few ones that I

(5:55) have chosen to notice." And this changes

(5:57) the interaction. It's no longer some

(5:59) subordinate asking for a chance. It's

(6:01) this transaction between equals

(6:02) confirmation that they both belong in

(6:04) the same world, right? The world

(6:05) building has been created here. The

(6:07) founder in reading that email has their

(6:09) own identity as a good leader of a

(6:11) worthy mission, it's been reinforced.

(6:13) Okay? And this is called confirmation

(6:15) bias. You're favoring information that

(6:17) whatever existing belief you have that

(6:18) you're looking for that kind of

(6:20) information. Forget labor and all that.

(6:21) He was selling an identity that the

(6:23) founder was already desperate to buy.

(6:25) And that is god tier persuasion. So what

(6:27) can we learn from this? Good writing is

(6:29) about building a world for your

(6:30) audience. So email works because it fits

(6:32) in a world that already exists. That Y

(6:34) cominator, that startup lingo, the kind

(6:36) of world they exist, the kind of

(6:37) language they use, it's already there.

(6:39) It's all part of their head. And the

(6:40) secret to all successful storytelling is

(6:42) this thing called worldb buildinging.

(6:43) And we're going to learn very deeply

(6:45) what worldbuing is.

(6:56) There are two types of world building.

(6:58) Either you build a world from scratch or

(7:00) you fit into a world the audience is

(7:02) already familiar with, one that they're

(7:04) already in. Let's talk about how to fit

(7:06) in a world first. What So did this is

(7:09) the easier part compared to building a

(7:11) world from scratch. You can take any

(7:13) community you are already part of and

(7:15) you'll know what they agree on and it's

(7:17) easier to communicate with them. You can

(7:19) convince your friends on some idea. For

(7:21) example, Sohham understood the founder

(7:24) world. But you can't convince

(7:25) communities you don't know because you

(7:27) can't fit in because you have no idea

(7:29) what their world is. Remember, every

(7:31) world, no matter how complex, is built

(7:34) from simple atomic units. In writing,

(7:37) these are the foundational points that

(7:39) require the least amount of new

(7:41) information for your reader to accept.

(7:43) Think of them as points of common

(7:45) ground. They're often so obvious that

(7:47) they feel unnecessary to state because

(7:49) they're the foundation of that world.

(7:50) For example, for a business proposal, if

(7:52) you say something like, "Hey, we all

(7:54) want the company to grow, right?" Or for

(7:56) a health article, "Everyone wants to

(7:58) feel healthy and have more energy,

(8:00) right?" For a political argument, "We

(8:02) all want our children to live in a safe

(8:04) community, right? You start with these

(8:06) simple lowinformation points because

(8:08) they're non-controversial. They

(8:10) establish a shared foundation. Once the

(8:12) reader has nodded along to your atomic

(8:14) units, you can begin to construct more

(8:16) complex structures on top of them. For

(8:18) example, once you've established that,

(8:20) hey, we all want the company to grow,

(8:22) you can then introduce them to a more

(8:24) specific idea. One of the biggest

(8:25) obstacles to our growth right now is our

(8:27) outdated sales process. You are leading

(8:30) the reader from a broad agreement to a

(8:32) more specific problem within the world

(8:34) you are building. It's hard to know what

(8:36) atomic units are there in a world and

(8:38) what already exists. You can fit into

(8:41) someone else's world in two ways. One is

(8:43) you can zoom in on the problem. Like you

(8:46) describe their universe first, then zoom

(8:48) into a continent, then zoom into a city,

(8:49) then zoom into a location. You can also

(8:51) start the other way around. You can

(8:53) start with a location, then the city,

(8:54) then the continent, then the universe.

(8:56) Let me show you both zoom in and zoom

(8:59) out. I'll give you an example. If you're

(9:01) not in startups in India, like if you've

(9:02) never actually raised venture capital,

(9:04) you'll have no idea what big investors

(9:05) or founders in India want because they

(9:08) don't actually want to invest in

(9:09) slightly profitable startups. You all on

(9:12) the internet are like, "Oh, this startup

(9:13) is a little bit profitable." Actually,

(9:14) they don't care about that. Everyone

(9:16) sitting and telling big investors to

(9:17) invest in profitable startups are making

(9:19) a mistake because that's not what the

(9:21) investor's job is. For big investor

(9:23) mathematics to work, the company has to

(9:25) IPO or sell at a billion dollars or

(9:27) above. That's because big investors

(9:29) usually end up owning 20% of 20% of a

(9:32) company at max. Making a small company

(9:34) with a small profit is usually useless

(9:36) to them because the company will never

(9:38) sell at huge valuations. So they will

(9:40) not make money for the people who have

(9:42) invested in the investors. If you don't

(9:44) understand the big investor mathematics,

(9:46) you'll never produce a piece of writing

(9:48) that they like because it doesn't fit in

(9:50) their worldview. Now this makes it seem

(9:52) like no outsider can change a worldview

(9:54) of an ecosystem. But if you start with

(9:56) their worldview and then slowly as they

(9:58) nod along with your whatever piece of

(10:00) writing and then in agreement you flip

(10:02) it around and put in your own worldview

(10:04) that's how you change things. I like to

(10:07) call it a frame shift. I'll give you

(10:08) AOS's example. Like the big investor

(10:11) world in India didn't care much about

(10:12) content creation 10 years ago. But we

(10:14) start with the idea that hey well you

(10:17) need to build billion dollar companies

(10:18) and you need a good product and good

(10:20) marketing for that. By the way the word

(10:22) for marketing is GTM or go to market. So

(10:24) we'll use that word instead of marketing

(10:26) and then say by the way you know meta

(10:28) and Google ads are expensive and

(10:29) saturated and companies have to keep

(10:31) spending on it so there's cost of

(10:32) acquisition. Remember they're all

(10:34) nodding along here because this is their

(10:36) world. They already agree with you and

(10:38) then you say well there's a section of

(10:40) society that doesn't have a cost of

(10:42) acquisition for products and services

(10:43) they make and they're called content

(10:45) creators. So what if you stole the

(10:47) content creator game plan and built

(10:49) YouTube channels so you don't have a

(10:51) cost of acquisition over the long term

(10:53) and hence and zooming out of the world

(10:55) again you have a good alternative to the

(10:57) decline of Google and meta ads which

(10:59) means GTM which is go to market which is

(11:02) their word for marketing is solved which

(11:05) means as long as you have that and a

(11:06) good product you can build a billion

(11:08) dollar company plus because you're not

(11:10) spending on acquisition long-term the

(11:12) margins are better so better valuations

(11:17) Now next part of this is to give

(11:19) examples of your modified proposed

(11:21) world. You've given an example of their

(11:22) world with this content creation

(11:23) modification. Now you have to give

(11:25) supporting evidence. So then you point

(11:28) your finger and say look at physics

(11:30) walla. Physics walla is a content

(11:32) creator with low cost of acquisition and

(11:34) a billion dollar company. Then you show

(11:35) Mr. Beast and Fastables. Then you show

(11:38) Logan Paul and Prime. Then Kylie Jenner.

(11:40) The more examples the better. This takes

(11:42) this modified world that they don't

(11:44) fully agree with and solidifies it with

(11:46) examples. It roots the world. It grounds

(11:49) your story. Otherwise, you might be

(11:50) talking nonsense or some idea that

(11:52) hasn't happened yet. That's why it's so

(11:55) hard to do something without previous

(11:56) examples. The hardest thing for me was

(11:58) to convince other people when we started

(12:00) using AI avatars that people watch it

(12:02) before I had any proof. I did the same

(12:04) world building. People watch content,

(12:07) presenter gets tired, AI getting better,

(12:09) avatars getting better. Look, here's a

(12:11) low resolution version. That's why I run

(12:13) experiments. Sometimes when you don't

(12:14) have concrete examples, you have to

(12:16) resort to a prototype. I had an avatar

(12:18) prototype back then. That's why when

(12:20) startups raise money, but they don't

(12:22) have a full product, it's better to just

(12:24) go with a prototype. Just root it in

(12:26) some reality that people can touch and

(12:27) feel. So your world building feels real.

(12:30) But with avatars for YouTube and

(12:31) Instagram, we had a very early prototype

(12:33) and no examples of success. That's why

(12:35) my avatars at that point at least were

(12:37) such a big phenomenon to the point where

(12:39) even YouTube published that we were the

(12:40) world's largest avatar in the Davos book

(12:43) because once a case study is formed the

(12:45) example allows hundreds of other

(12:47) creators to root their stories. Hundreds

(12:49) of people can now point at me and say

(12:51) hey it worked for him therefore I can do

(12:53) it. It leads credibility to their

(12:55) stories. After that worked, we got to so

(12:58) much scale and made so much money, the

(13:00) rest of our storytelling got stronger

(13:01) because my ability to root modifications

(13:03) to other people's worlds started working

(13:06) better.

(13:08) I'm in the same place with game

(13:09) development now. There's no proof that

(13:11) India can make a top class 3D game. But

(13:13) if I prove it, it becomes a case study

(13:15) and other founders will point to it and

(13:17) be able to raise capital. But because we

(13:19) are going first, it'll be unlikely that

(13:21) we are able to raise capital because I

(13:23) have no previous examples of Indian

(13:24) success to show investors and root it in

(13:27) any world. I already knew this going in.

(13:29) That's why I had to wait so many years

(13:31) to do it. So that first I can generate

(13:33) enough cash to self-fund it. Trust me,

(13:35) unless there's some crazy investor, if

(13:37) you have no external examples of

(13:39) success, you get almost no funding. Or

(13:41) rather, it's rare. That's why that game

(13:43) Claire obscure was so important. It's

(13:45) the game of the year. And what was

(13:47) important was that it was made with

(13:48) Unreal Engine and with 30 people. So

(13:50) it's a good case study for other

(13:51) developers to root their story of hey we

(13:54) can do this with a small team. And this

(13:56) world building is not just important for

(13:57) investors, it's also important for your

(13:58) team. So as I showed my team that

(14:00) another 30-man team could do this, more

(14:03) confidence was built. Right now there's

(14:05) a massive demand for video editors. But

(14:07) it hasn't hit everyone's head yet. It

(14:09) will when people start going out and

(14:11) saying look I'm making this much LPA.

(14:12) Like in software engineering, a lot of

(14:14) the 2021 boom of software engineering

(14:16) was people making YouTube videos saying,

(14:18) "See, I'm making 40 LPA, 50 LPA." That's

(14:21) examples. That's world building. But in

(14:24) video editing, because we know the

(14:25) numbers, it is going to happen soon.

(14:28) The second part which is harder is

(14:30) making a world. Till now, we've been

(14:32) talking about how to fit into another

(14:33) person's world and make a modification.

(14:35) But making a world is really hard. I

(14:37) fundamentally don't think it's possible

(14:38) to make a world from scratch. You have

(14:40) to invent a new language and all of

(14:42) that. The closest I've seen is to take a

(14:44) little bit of somebody else's world.

(14:46) Like you cannot start a world completely

(14:47) from scratch, but you have to take a

(14:48) little bit of somebody else's world and

(14:50) then spin on top of it. I'll give you a

(14:52) best example of this. Have you watched

(14:53) Dune? I love Dune. I've read the books.

(14:56) I've watched the movie. I've played Dune

(14:57) Awakening the game. I think it's one of

(14:59) the best examples of world building

(15:01) ever. But let's talk a little more about

(15:03) Dune now. But before that, I want to

(15:05) take a second to talk about today's

(15:07) sponsor, Warp. You know how engineers

(15:09) today are running multiple AI agents

(15:11) locally to fix bugs or to implement

(15:13) features? Well, while the agents work

(15:15) fine, there's a big problem with it.

(15:17) Context switching. Either you lose track

(15:19) of agents or your machine just gives up

(15:20) since all these agents are running

(15:22) locally. And to solve exactly that, WP

(15:24) has launched Oz that lets you run

(15:26) practically infinite number of agents in

(15:28) the cloud. The setup takes just 10

(15:29) minutes and you can trigger these agents

(15:31) from almost anywhere like Slack

(15:33) messages, GitHub issues, linear tickets,

(15:35) or even the W terminal itself. Plus, you

(15:37) get a single dashboard where you can

(15:39) manage all your agents and even schedule

(15:40) them to trigger on a recurring basis. On

(15:42) top of it, if an agent is going in the

(15:44) wrong direction, you can jump in live

(15:46) and steer it in the right direction.

(15:47) Having said that, you should check out

(15:49) Wu today and get an extra 1,000 AI

(15:51) credits towards Oz. Link in description.

(15:54) At the most immediate level, the

(15:56) language of Fman and Dune, the native

(15:59) inhabitants of this desert called

(16:00) Arachus, is full of Arabic and Islamic

(16:03) terms. The messiah figure Paul Atrades

(16:06) is given the title madib which in Arabic

(16:09) translates to teacher or educator. His

(16:12) feminin name usul derives from the

(16:14) Arabic word meaning principles of

(16:16) fundamentals. Other examples around such

(16:18) as lisan algib the tongue of the unseen

(16:21) in Arabic. The religious and little bit

(16:22) of like you know the messiah vibe of

(16:24) dune are also heavily influenced by

(16:26) Islam. The concept of the Mahadi, a

(16:29) prophesized redeemer in Islam who will

(16:31) appear before the day of judgment is a

(16:33) clear parallel to whatever's happening

(16:35) with the Fman and Lisan Algib. So

(16:36) there's a little bit of that context, a

(16:38) little bit of world building taken from

(16:39) somewhere else that people can

(16:40) understand. Now here's the spin.

(17:22) The author put in sand worms. massive

(17:24) sand worms and so much lore around it.

(17:27) Why they exist, what their properties

(17:29) are. Then to root the world, lots of

(17:32) consistent examples. In the real world,

(17:34) this could be water or later oil. The

(17:36) most valuable substance in his universe,

(17:39) the spice milange is not a mineral to be

(17:41) mined, but a biological byproduct of the

(17:44) sandworm's life cycle. It's their

(17:46) excrement, their waste. They excrete it

(17:48) into the sand and then it's exposed to

(17:50) the elements to become the spice. Now,

(17:52) here's the rooting. This immediately

(17:54) creates the central conflict of the

(17:56) entire saga. The great political houses,

(17:58) they don't just want to control a

(17:59) desert. They want to control the

(18:00) treasure in the desert, the spice. The

(18:03) entire galactic economy depends on this

(18:05) worm's byproduct for travel and skills.

(18:07) Spice isn't just collected. There's the

(18:09) spice blow that happens. There's a

(18:11) massive explosion of sand and raw spice,

(18:14) which is a direct consequence of a

(18:15) pre-spice mass growing deep underground

(18:18) and reacting with water. This makes

(18:20) this, you know, anytime they harvest

(18:22) spice, it's a dramatic, dangerous, and

(18:24) very time-sensitive operation. The Fman,

(18:26) the people who live in harmony with the

(18:27) worms, they secretly control huge

(18:30) stockpiles of the spice, and they're the

(18:32) wealthiest people in the universe.

(18:33) Technically, the Fman have learned how

(18:35) to master them. They learn to ride these

(18:37) big sandworms, and that's their primary

(18:39) means of long-distance transport. And

(18:41) it's a physical skill. It requires like

(18:43) a hook used to pry open a segment. You

(18:46) open a little bit of the worms plating.

(18:48) It exposes the sensitive flesh and

(18:49) allows them to steer it by causing

(18:51) irritation. A fman who can summon and

(18:53) ride a sandworm. A sand rider, it's

(18:56) called a sand rider. It's like a title

(18:57) of immense respect, like a job title. It

(18:59) becomes a right of passage proving their

(19:02) courage and showing you how the fmen are

(19:04) deep inside the aracus ecosystem. And I

(19:07) think if you've read any religious

(19:08) textbooks, many religions have sacred

(19:10) rituals involving psychoactive

(19:12) substances, drugs where you transform

(19:14) and you connect with the divine. So in

(19:16) his books, taking the spice makes you

(19:18) high. Also in the game, it gives you

(19:20) extra skills. All consistent

(19:22) storytelling. And in order to be

(19:23) consistent and give examples, he goes

(19:25) super micro like the hooks on the

(19:27) sandworm. Any other storyteller wouldn't

(19:29) have gone that deep. So he's taken an

(19:31) existing world and added so much depth

(19:33) to it. And the more depth that's added,

(19:34) the more it's consistent, the more it's

(19:36) rooted. Any other storyteller wouldn't

(19:37) have gone that deep. By all these small

(19:40) micro interactions, the world has depth.

(19:43) It is rooted. Anyway, let's go to the

(19:46) next segment.

(19:50) People really like Dune. You can get

(19:52) totally immersed in the world, the

(19:54) relationships between the characters,

(19:56) and whenever you get transport into

(19:57) Arachus in the movies, it's just so

(20:00) good. And movies, you can even get

(20:02) deeper into the storytelling by adding

(20:04) in music and visuals. Again, with its

(20:07) influences and then subtle twists to

(20:09) root it. Every time you see a sky shot,

(20:11) a certain type of music plays. Every

(20:13) time it goes to the bad faction, some

(20:15) different music plays. But it's

(20:16) consistent. If it shows the sky shot,

(20:19) that old music plays again. This

(20:21) relationships between music, characters,

(20:24) locations, going micro, it's very

(20:26) important.

(20:28) Like I've always had a problem with

(20:29) Superman. When he saves people who are

(20:32) falling, he's going really fast. In a

(20:34) city like this, that should kill the

(20:36) person he's catching. It's like being

(20:38) hit by a 6' long bullet. It's

(20:40) inconsistent with physics. when he wears

(20:43) glasses, why don't people recognize him?

(20:45) Both of these in the comics are

(20:46) explained in a very dumb way. In one of

(20:48) the Superman comics, they said that

(20:49) Superman doesn't hurt people when he

(20:51) flies fast because he has a protective

(20:53) barrier that emits from him. With the

(20:56) glasses, they wrote in one of the comics

(20:57) that it's a hypnosis glasses. Like,

(20:59) these are not good, welloughtout

(21:01) examples. It's not like Dune. And I

(21:04) think Superman did well because it was

(21:05) written at a time where there's not so

(21:06) much media. So, it's a little bit harder

(21:09) to be caught in the world of DC comics

(21:11) on the big screen, and that's what's

(21:13) happened to them. Whereas on the big

(21:15) screen, Marvel does it better. Watch.

(21:27) >> Wait, who are you?

(21:30) >> You know, Marvel managed to erase some

(21:32) of the stupidity in the comics. I like

(21:34) the micro interactions between Doctor

(21:36) Strange and Spider-Man. The reason that

(21:38) Thanos belts the Hulk the first time

(21:40) they meet is to set up Thanos as this

(21:43) badass. They showed Thanos in many

(21:45) movies as this big bad. Again and again,

(21:47) you'd see Thanos in the ending of those

(21:49) movies. They referenced him many times.

(21:51) And his first showing, you can see he's

(21:53) the real threat because he beats up the

(21:55) Hulk, which is at that point one of the

(21:57) strongest characters they had built up.

(21:59) That's called foreshadowing. All of the

(22:01) small sequences of Thanos before the

(22:03) final movies is all setting up a small

(22:05) part of the universe ready for the final

(22:07) reveal later. That's how you build the

(22:10) universe. And once you've designed your

(22:11) world, you need to make it easy for

(22:13) people to enter and explore. This is

(22:15) where the craft of writing comes in. The

(22:17) principles of good writing are all about

(22:20) cognitive hospitality. You're making a

(22:22) world that's friendly for people to

(22:23) enter. Anything that the user strongly

(22:25) disagrees with, break immersion. Masters

(22:28) of writing like Paul Graham and William

(22:30) Zissner all preach the gospel of be

(22:33) simple. Use ordinary words, write clean

(22:36) sentences, omit needless words. It's all

(22:39) about reducing the load on your brain.

(22:41) The brain has an immune system that

(22:43) rejects new ideas and new words. The

(22:46) less energy your reader has to spend

(22:48) decoding your writing, the more the

(22:50) brain takes in the idea. That's why GPD

(22:52) writing is so bad right now. It's all

(22:54) very, very wordy. This brain and immune

(22:56) system idea is very important.

(22:59) Do you know why the most likely people

(23:01) to start believing in random stuff like

(23:03) chakras and motivational gurus and some

(23:05) obscure stuff when they're broken in in

(23:07) life? Because the brain becomes

(23:09) suggestive. The immune system of that

(23:10) brain drops. Whereas it's very hard to

(23:12) convince someone with a high ego to

(23:14) change. People go to temples and

(23:16) churches when they are at their lowest.

(23:17) Psychedelic drugs, for example, also

(23:19) make you very suggestive. You're more

(23:21) likely to believe things on them.

(23:23) Do you know why AOS has done so well in

(23:25) the last 2 years? I keep thinking about

(23:26) it because we accidentally found

(23:28) something. We found that very good video

(23:29) editing drops the immune system of the

(23:31) brain. It was a totally accidental

(23:33) finding and because we have a we have we

(23:35) were anyway producing video editors. We

(23:38) are producing the spice. You just don't

(23:41) see it yet. And are you seeing what I'm

(23:42) doing right now? I'm building a

(23:43) universe. I'm rooting my story in

(23:45) examples that I previously gave you

(23:47) within your world. You can use these

(23:49) principles to guide your reader. The

(23:51) first piece of information you provide

(23:53) heavily influences what comes next. Your

(23:56) title and first sentence are powerful

(23:58) anchors. An app that does rag with LLMs,

(24:02) it's a boring conversation. But saying

(24:04) Rahul is using this app to prepare for

(24:06) his exam in 5 minutes immediately shows

(24:09) a compelling human benefit, something

(24:11) that people can understand. And humans

(24:13) are fundamentally wired for stories, not

(24:15) for numbers. A concrete story is very

(24:17) memorable, very persuasive. Instead of

(24:20) saying our solution improves

(24:22) productivity, tell a story. Himish, one

(24:24) of our top reps used to spend all his

(24:26) Friday afternoon updating spreadsheets.

(24:29) Now that process is automated and last

(24:31) Friday person closed two extra deals.

(24:33) That's five lakhs extra they closed.

(24:35) This makes the benefit tangible. Like I

(24:37) said, you need to keep it simple and not

(24:39) stray too far from what the reader

(24:40) believes. It's not possible to change

(24:42) the world that quickly. You need to

(24:44) change it in steps. people thinking I'll

(24:45) come and change the world entirely

(24:46) change all of this rapidly changes the

(24:48) world will not believe you the more

(24:50) unbelievable the story the harder it is

(24:52) to buy it I know a guy who makes a 100

(24:54) crores a year liquid when he goes on a

(24:56) podcast and gives examples of people's

(24:58) annual earnings he always says just five

(25:00) lakhs just so people relate because he

(25:02) knows and even I know that if he goes

(25:03) out there and talks about well making

(25:05) 100 crores nobody would relate it's not

(25:07) rooted in any world right so people be

(25:09) like this is this is all in the air and

(25:11) I think the greatest enemy of clear

(25:12) writing is what the cognitive science

(25:14) Scientist Steven Pinker calls the curse

(25:16) of knowledge. This is the inability to

(25:18) imagine what it is like for someone

(25:20) else. This guy understand because he

(25:22) knows people won't understand the 100

(25:24) crore example. I'll give you another

(25:25) example. Right? Zerva founders have been

(25:27) making thousands of crores per year, no

(25:28) one cares. No one bats an eye. The

(25:30) minute news came out that they're taking

(25:31) 100 cr salary, everyone lost their

(25:34) This is because people relate to the

(25:35) word salary more than dividend. Breaking

(25:37) this curse requires a conscious act of

(25:39) empathy. You must constantly ask, "What

(25:41) does my reader know? What is the

(25:42) simplest possible way to say this? What

(25:44) context am I assuming? And this leads to

(25:46) a very obvious conclusion about

(25:48) simplicity. Writing simply is not

(25:50) dumbing it down. That's not what writing

(25:52) simply is. It's a sign of respect. When

(25:54) we make our reels, when I do my short

(25:56) form reels and make it simple, it's not

(25:58) because I'm not technical or I don't

(25:59) understand it. It's because we respect

(26:01) our wider audience and fit into their

(26:03) worldview what they can understand.

(26:05) Because it's simpler, it gets a lot more

(26:07) scale because more people can understand

(26:08) it. Sometimes I get attacked right for

(26:11) for making these simple res. The people

(26:13) attacking are mostly young. So I don't

(26:14) blame them. The easier you make, the

(26:17) easier you scale because you fit into

(26:18) everyone's worldview. It's why Tan

(26:20) tweets about cricket and Rani talks

(26:22) about ghosts. Everyone understands to

(26:24) write simply to use ordinary words,

(26:26) clean sentences is all important, but

(26:28) you need to make sure it's rooted in a

(26:29) world that other people understand. You

(26:31) are giving them a gift, a clean,

(26:32) efficient program that runs smoothly in

(26:35) their operating system instead of you

(26:36) asking them to download your operating

(26:38) system. The best storytellers have

(26:40) something called reach from ground

(26:42) truth. I I invented this this concept,

(26:44) right? Without telling a lie. How far

(26:46) can you stretch a person's brain from

(26:48) what they believe? How far off their own

(26:51) axis can you get them to go without

(26:53) having to tell lies? That is the true

(26:54) test of a storyteller. Can I convince

(26:56) somebody who hates this country that's a

(26:58) good country? Can I convince a person

(27:00) who doesn't want to have kids to have

(27:01) kids? Can I convince a person who is an

(27:03) atheist to believe in religion? All

(27:04) without telling a lie. And I think the

(27:06) amateur writer like they try to brute

(27:08) force this. They'll bombard the reader

(27:09) with facts that contradict their world.

(27:11) They be like, "No, no, you're wrong.

(27:13) This is how it is." That never works.

(27:15) The skilled persuader does the opposite.

(27:17) They'll begin by validating a part of

(27:18) the reader's belief system. You are

(27:20) right to be skeptical of new marketing

(27:22) fads. Most of them are waste of time and

(27:24) money. That's why it's important to look

(27:26) at the few that are grounded in

(27:27) fundamental principles. Once you build

(27:29) that rapo, it lowers defense before you

(27:31) introduce a new and different idea. And

(27:33) I'm telling you, the world hates new

(27:35) ideas. You might think the world likes

(27:36) new ideas. It doesn't. And the only way

(27:38) to deliver a new idea is to first start

(27:40) with an old idea and step by step.

(27:44) The second thing is we judge the

(27:46) likelihood of an event by how easily an

(27:48) example comes to mind. This is also the

(27:50) engine behind powerful storytelling. A

(27:52) very concrete story is way more

(27:54) persuasive than any numbers or

(27:55) statistics. 92% of customers are

(27:57) satisfied. No one cares. that story the

(28:00) first one of some Raj Raju uh you know

(28:03) suddenly seeing using your product and

(28:05) doing well and making more money becomes

(28:07) more available to the mind. I'll give

(28:09) you an example in countless adventure

(28:11) movies quicksand is a mortal threat. You

(28:13) know quicksand you walk into quicksand

(28:15) you'll sink into it. It's a terrifying

(28:17) way to die. The reality is that while

(28:20) quicksand is a real thing it's a real

(28:22) phenomenon. It's almost impossible to

(28:24) die in that way. Humans are less dense

(28:26) than quicksand, meaning we are naturally

(28:28) buoyant in it. You would sink, but only

(28:30) up till the waste. The real danger is

(28:32) not being sucked under, but rather

(28:34) getting stuck and dying from

(28:36) dehydration, exposure or starvation.

(28:38) Annual deaths worldwide from quicksand

(28:40) are negligible. Maybe single digits out

(28:43) of, you know, 8 billion, 9 billion

(28:44) people in the world. Many people discuss

(28:46) sharks, terrorists, plane crashes as

(28:49) threats. Let me just tell you, more

(28:50) people in the world die from diarrhea

(28:52) than from sharks, terrorists, and plane

(28:54) crashes. combined. But you can't use

(28:56) diarrhea in your story as a threat. You

(28:58) would have more success with terrorists

(28:59) or plane crashes because they're more

(29:01) recent and they come to mind easily. So

(29:03) let's go back to telling a person a

(29:05) story that changes their mind radically.

(29:07) The easiest way is to induce something

(29:09) called dissonance. Present the reader

(29:10) with two ideas which they believe are

(29:12) true but which are in conflict. I'll

(29:14) give you an example. Okay, so you're

(29:15) saying code is more valuable than

(29:16) content. Correct. Many people agree,

(29:18) especially engineers. But how many apps

(29:20) have you downloaded last year versus how

(29:22) many new creators or channels or Twitter

(29:24) accounts have you followed? What is the

(29:26) number? If you argue that funding,

(29:28) salaries, etc. come because there is

(29:30) usage of something. Therefore, there

(29:31) must be producers and producers need

(29:33) talent and capital, then you're saying

(29:35) that content is going to explode as an

(29:37) industry because you're watching so much

(29:38) more of it right now than downloading

(29:40) new apps. You're watching it right now.

(29:42) The app you're watching it on, YouTube,

(29:44) is a very old app and doesn't require

(29:46) too many engineers to run anymore. But

(29:48) that one app supports hundreds of

(29:51) thousands of creators who all need to

(29:52) hire. You see where I'm getting at? This

(29:54) is the way, right? First you establish

(29:56) something that you think you know that

(29:58) people believe in and then you say but

(30:00) I'm deviating a little bit. Then do you

(30:01) agree with this follow on? That's the

(30:03) thing. And the last thing as a

(30:04) storyteller is you need to provide

(30:06) resolution. Your idea is not just

(30:08) another proposal, right? Like you want

(30:09) to release them from this problem of

(30:11) having two conflicting thoughts. Now you

(30:13) put the reader in a problem that they

(30:14) need to solve. That is why almost all

(30:17) the stories these days I tell are true.

(30:20) Everything I have told you in this video

(30:21) is 100% true. My job is not to come up

(30:24) with stories. It's to actually find

(30:26) hidden but true stories or stories that

(30:28) the world doesn't believe in but are

(30:29) true. Like the devs, you know, going out

(30:31) of business over a few years. One more

(30:32) thing is that most writers make the

(30:34) mistake of treating all their points as

(30:36) equal. They'll present one laundry list

(30:38) of reasons and hoping that you know if I

(30:40) give you 10 points as to why this will

(30:42) work, it'll be persuasive. This is the

(30:44) engineering answer syndrome. You, you

(30:46) know, in an engineering answer in

(30:47) college, we just put many points and

(30:48) hope that you'll get more marks because

(30:50) one of the points will be right. In real

(30:51) life, there are no part markings. In an

(30:53) argument, the highest leverage point is

(30:56) the single core assumption upon which

(30:59) the entire opposing view rests. For

(31:01) example, for a long time, people said

(31:02) that making AAA game has a $100 million

(31:04) budget. You break that down, it's about

(31:06) $25 million of dev budget and $75

(31:09) million of marketing budget. Let's break

(31:11) that dev budget down. $25 million of dev

(31:14) budget the starting salary of an

(31:15) engineer in the US is $200,000 for a

(31:18) decent C++ engineer in India for a

(31:20) starting salary isn't it onetenth of

(31:22) that cost so technically you're saying

(31:24) the entire dev budget in India for a

(31:26) game of this quality could be onetenth

(31:28) of what it is in the US and then you say

(31:30) well there are new tools like

(31:31) photoggrammetry and this and that so it

(31:33) should be even lesser than you know

(31:34) onetenth of the cost that is how you

(31:36) flow in instead of fighting 10 different

(31:38) surface level symptoms uh and get into a

(31:41) bad argument the master writer and even

(31:43) the master businessman identifies the

(31:45) one flawed premise at its root. Why

(31:47) should it cost $100 million to make a

(31:49) game in India? Should cost much lesser

(31:51) than that. And on the marketing side, if

(31:53) you're into content, you'll figure out

(31:55) marketing for free if you know how to

(31:56) make memes. I'll give you another

(31:58) example, right? I was hiring a CFO and

(32:00) let me tell you, a CFO is expensive. We

(32:02) have 500 employees now and we absolutely

(32:03) need a CFO. And I called the guy whose

(32:06) company I was hiring from. He's actually

(32:07) shutting it down. So, he's letting the

(32:08) CFO go. And I said, "Hey, give me five

(32:10) reasons I should hire him at this

(32:11) price." It's a huge price. He said,

(32:13) "Bro, this is a gut decision." And

(32:15) instead of falling short of his

(32:16) expectation and giving him whatever,

(32:17) two, three lakhs less, whatever amount

(32:19) it is, just close one more deal. Having

(32:21) a CFO means you can close your eyes and

(32:23) go faster. No, he'll help you close 10

(32:25) times more deals. And I trust him on

(32:26) that. And that's it. That line convinced

(32:29) me. Not one five arguments as to in his

(32:31) CV what he's done in the past, this that

(32:33) just okay, if I hire this person and I

(32:34) pay him a little more, I can go much

(32:36) faster. Like I said, he could have given

(32:38) me five reasons, but ultimately he had

(32:40) to just fit my worldview of okay,

(32:42) company's growing. He already knew that.

(32:45) I just needed someone to handle the back

(32:47) office and the amount difference doesn't

(32:48) matter if you're growing that fast.

(32:50) Better to have the best person for this

(32:52) than haggling for a small amount here

(32:54) and there. And the minute he said, "I

(32:56) trust this person," that became the most

(32:58) important reason because I trust the

(33:00) person I was speaking to. So instead of

(33:02) glazing five points, one was enough for

(33:04) me and that one converted me. And now I

(33:07) just want you to know I tricked you.

(33:09) This video is not about writing. It's

(33:11) not about persuasion. This video all it

(33:14) while was about prompting. The best way

(33:17) to think about good prompting is that it

(33:19) is worldbuilding for the AI. Let's get

(33:21) very technical. My claim that effective

(33:24) prompting is akin to worldbuilding for

(33:25) AI is not just an analogy. It's an exact

(33:29) technically accurate description of how

(33:31) we guide large language models. If you

(33:34) can take all the principles I just

(33:36) taught you and move it into prompting,

(33:38) you are essentially constructing a

(33:41) temporary reality for the model to

(33:42) inhabit, you're creating a universe for

(33:44) the model and you're influencing its

(33:46) behavior at the fundamental levels of

(33:47) machine learning, especially when it

(33:49) comes to how token embeddings work and

(33:51) attention mechanisms work. I'll now get

(33:54) a little bit technical and then tell you

(33:55) why everything you learned in this video

(33:57) is also going to help you no matter what

(33:59) job you're doing.

(34:01) An LLM in its raw state, you can

(34:04) conceptualize it as a vast

(34:06) high-dimensional probability space

(34:08) represented by its token embeddings. Let

(34:10) me make that simple. Every word or token

(34:12) has a numerical vector representation.

(34:14) And the relationship between these

(34:16) vectors defines the model's

(34:18) understanding of language and concepts.

(34:20) Without a specific prompt, the model

(34:22) exists in a state of just potential

(34:24) capable of generating nearly anything

(34:25) from its training data. A well-crafted

(34:28) prompt acts as a set of physical laws

(34:31) for a small universe. So every time you

(34:33) prompt something, you're constraining

(34:34) the universe. Here's the technical

(34:35) breakdown. First, there's something

(34:37) called an initial state vector. When you

(34:39) provide a prompt, the text is tokenized

(34:41) and then converted into a sequence of

(34:43) embedding vectors. This initial sequence

(34:45) of vectors defines the starting point

(34:47) and a trajectory within the model's

(34:49) enormous embedding space. So vectors for

(34:52) similar concepts will be very

(34:53) mathematically close. the vector for

(34:55) gang signs would be closer to the words

(34:58) gully and hood than it is to five-star

(35:00) hotel. A generic prompt like tell me a

(35:02) story places the model in a very broad

(35:05) undefined region of the space. On the

(35:07) opposite side, a very detailed prompt

(35:09) like write a detective story set in 2049

(35:12) cyberpunk India where the protagonist is

(35:14) a detective who only communicates in

(35:16) gang science immediately teleports the

(35:18) model to a highly specific constrained

(35:21) space in its embedding space. You're

(35:22) creating a universe for the model. Every

(35:24) time you prompt, you're creating a

(35:25) universe. So smaller the prompt, the

(35:27) more it's putting in context for the

(35:29) universe from the generic whatever

(35:30) statistically likely. But the minute you

(35:32) are very specific about what you want,

(35:34) you are creating the world. And just

(35:35) like in Dune, you can get as specific as

(35:37) the hooks inside the sandworms and then

(35:39) your world is even more richer. Next is

(35:42) the contextual modulation of embeddings.

(35:44) Don't get confused by this technicality.

(35:46) Token embeddings are not static. There's

(35:48) something called contextual modulation.

(35:50) Meaning that the representation of a

(35:52) token is influenced by the tokens around

(35:54) it. A very rich prompt filled with

(35:56) specific entities, relationships, any

(35:58) sort of cues. It creates this contextual

(36:01) field we spoke about. This field you

(36:03) know it physically warps the local space

(36:06) making everything more defined. It's

(36:08) trying to make a world where your

(36:10) concepts are now more probable and less

(36:12) the models. Think of your prompt taking

(36:14) the model from basically everything to a

(36:16) very specific universe using your words.

(36:19) You're basically going from a zoomed out

(36:21) world where everything is generic

(36:22) because that's what AI surface is to a

(36:24) very specific world. You are shap you're

(36:26) like a it's like it's better seen as

(36:27) like a you know clay pot. You're not

(36:29) putting the pieces of pot together.

(36:30) You're just shaping it with your hands.

(36:32) Right? Similarly with your words you're

(36:34) shaping the world into what you want.

(36:36) But if you only you know shape a little

(36:37) bit only one part of the world will be

(36:39) what you want. The rest will be generic

(36:41) pot. You are actually spawning universes

(36:44) every time you prompt. And some of you

(36:46) are making very shitty universes which

(36:48) are very generic. It's like making a

(36:50) clay pot but you know pressing only on

(36:52) one side. The rest of the side is just

(36:54) going to be generic whatever the pot

(36:55) was. Anyway, the transformer

(36:57) architecture which is the foundation

(36:59) behind every modern LLM. It has

(37:01) something called attention. It has a

(37:03) mechanism called attention. Attention

(37:05) allows the model to weigh the importance

(37:07) of different tokens in the input when

(37:10) generating a new token. So, a detailed

(37:12) prompt is essentially telling the model

(37:15) what you should pay attention to, what

(37:16) you should focus on. Think of the

(37:18) attention mechanism as a spotlight.

(37:20) Okay? The model shines this spotlight on

(37:23) the context. A very vague prompt is

(37:25) giving the model very little direction

(37:27) on where to shine this light. Tell me a

(37:29) story. It makes the model aim, you know,

(37:32) wander aimlessly. It's going to, you

(37:34) know, pick up the most generic story it

(37:35) can think of. A detailed worldbuing

(37:38) prompt provides a very clear script. For

(37:41) example, in our detective story prompt,

(37:43) the attention mechanism will naturally

(37:45) assign higher weights to tokens related

(37:47) to detective gang science, cyberpunk

(37:50) India and then generate subsequent text.

(37:53) And I think all advanced prompting

(37:54) techniques can be seen more directly as

(37:57) a form of world building. That's what it

(37:59) is. Advanced prompting is world

(38:01) building. For example, AI always

(38:03) generates sentences with negations,

(38:04) right? It's not just X, it's Y. You've

(38:07) seen AI generate, AI writing sound like

(38:09) this. We're not just writing a script,

(38:10) we're baking cakes, stuff like that. But

(38:13) you can steer your world not to do that.

(38:15) Give it that specific example and say,

(38:16) "Don't do this." Setting the physical

(38:19) rules for your world and you can nudge

(38:21) its outputs towards any desired style,

(38:23) personality or knowledge base. This is

(38:26) the technical equivalent of setting

(38:27) laws. Just like we have laws in our, you

(38:30) know, you know, cars can't go specific.

(38:31) I mean India breaks all laws but you

(38:33) know in most laws the entire reason for

(38:35) laws is you can tell what the world will

(38:37) be could be you know anything can happen

(38:39) but you know these sort of things will

(38:40) very rarely happen because laws exist

(38:42) whereas in the world with physics

(38:44) physics is our law set for the entire

(38:46) universe right you know nothing can

(38:48) violate the rules of physics so you can

(38:50) set those rules you are the rule maker

(38:52) you are the law law maker you are the

(38:53) god that's spawning universes and I

(38:56) think it's quite lame to be a god and

(38:58) say you know to to just have a threeline

(39:00) prompt like that's that's not what you

(39:02) should be doing. The ability of LLMs

(39:05) also to do in context learning is

(39:07) important. If you provide examples and

(39:09) very explicit instructions, you are

(39:11) essentially giving the model a very

(39:12) condensed instruction manual for the

(39:14) world it's about to simulate. Like I

(39:15) said, you're writing laws. I told you in

(39:17) normal writing examples ground the

(39:19) story. We've spoken about this on the

(39:20) storytelling part. When you provide a

(39:22) few examples, we call it few short

(39:23) prompting of the desired output or

(39:25) style. You are giving the AI enough of

(39:28) that world building and laws and lore

(39:30) for your world. The model then uses

(39:33) these examples to infer the underlying

(39:36) patterns and rules of your world. To

(39:37) give you an example in Dune, if you

(39:39) don't mention Dune to AI and you just

(39:40) tell it, okay, there are sand worms,

(39:42) there's this sand, there's these

(39:43) multiple waring nations, etc., etc. You

(39:45) know, if somebody wanted to ride the

(39:46) worm, how would they do it? What device

(39:48) would they use to do it? And believe it

(39:50) or not, AI will actually give you the

(39:51) idea of the hooks because Dune is there

(39:53) in its training data. But that's the

(39:55) thing, you don't need to specify

(39:56) everything. You just need to specify

(39:57) enough of the world. For example, if you

(40:00) ask what are the top two successful

(40:01) Indian businesses, it'll give you some

(40:02) examples. But if you ask it for more

(40:04) specifics, you give it like very

(40:05) specific examples, say I want businesses

(40:07) like this. Then it'll give you a very

(40:08) different type of business. For example,

(40:10) if you ask for what are the top Indian

(40:11) businesses, it'll give you, you know,

(40:13) Amanis and Adanis and whatnot. But you

(40:15) can get very specific. Do you want bua

(40:17) type businesses, food businesses,

(40:19) startups? It really depends on your

(40:22) examples because the AI is thinking in a

(40:23) very different way, is spawning a very

(40:25) different world, but you can shape how

(40:27) this world goes. Anyway, the entire

(40:29) point is that world building when it

(40:31) comes to writing for a reader or

(40:33) prompting are exactly the same thing.

(40:36) They're two parts of the same coin and

(40:37) if you get good at one, you get good at

(40:39) the other. Till now, most people with

(40:41) hard skills in India didn't really need

(40:42) to get good at world building or

(40:44) writing. But after AI, I think it's a

(40:46) critical skill that everyone needs to

(40:47) know. And I hope this video has gotten

(40:49) you started thinking about writing and

(40:51) thinking about thinking because writing

(40:52) is a form of thinking. So definitely go

(40:54) read some more, practice as much as you

(40:57) can and do not lazy prompt either AI or

(41:00) any of your readers. That's it for me.

(41:03) Bye.
