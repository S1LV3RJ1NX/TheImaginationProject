Remember that game I mentioned a few weeks ago? The one with no graphics?

It's ready. And it works on Android now too.

You enter a chamber. You type what you'd do. The world responds.

One of my playtesters got stuck for 20 minutes on a room where the only way out was to tell the truth to a stone guard. He kept trying to fight it.

20 chambers like that. Each one different.

No ads. No in-app purchases. Just puzzles that test how your mind actually works.

Launching on both App Store and Play Store this week:
