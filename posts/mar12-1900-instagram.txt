CAPTION:

I built a game that tells you how you think.

It doesn't ask multiple-choice questions. It drops you into 20 scenarios and watches what you do.

Do you examine every detail before acting? Or jump in?
Do you negotiate? Or demand?
Do you follow the rules? Or find a loophole?

Every chamber reveals a different side of you. At the end, the game tells you your archetype.

Project Imagination. No graphics. Just your mind.

Coming this week to iOS and Android. Link in bio.
