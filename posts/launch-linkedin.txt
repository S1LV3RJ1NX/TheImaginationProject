Project Imagination is live on the App Store and Google Play.

A dusty room. A locked box. Three dials on the lock. Most numbers are worn smooth, but three still have sharp edges. A faded note reads: "In order, they open the path."

You type "try 247." The lock clicks open.

That's the first chamber. There are nineteen more. Each one tests a different part of how your mind works.

In one, you're a judge deciding a dispute between a farmer and a merchant. In another, you must convince a silent stone guard to let you pass. In another, the room itself is the puzzle.

No graphics. No ads. No in-app purchases. Just text and your imagination.

Thank you to everyone who joined the waitlist and believed in a game with no visuals.
