Project Imagination is live on the App Store.

A text-based puzzle game with zero graphics. You enter a chamber, type what you'd do, and the world responds.

20 handcrafted chambers — riddles, mysteries, moral dilemmas, social deduction. No ads. No in-app purchases.

Thank you to everyone who joined the waitlist and believed in a game with no graphics.
