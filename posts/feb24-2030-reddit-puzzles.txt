SUBREDDIT: r/puzzles

TITLE: I design text-based puzzle chambers - here's one that stumped 80% of playtesters

BODY:

I'm building a game called Project Imagination where each level is a text-based chamber with a unique puzzle.

One of my favorites: you enter a room with a locked door, a mirror, a candle, and an inscription that reads "only the truthful may pass." There's a stranger in the corner who answers every question, but you don't know if they're lying.

The solution isn't what most people expect. Playtesters who tried brute-force logic got stuck. The ones who thought about it differently solved it in 3 moves.

I'm launching on iOS soon. Waitlist is here if you're interested:

Without spoiling it, how would you approach that chamber?
