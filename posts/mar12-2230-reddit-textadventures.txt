Title: Built a modern text adventure with AI narration and NLP input -- 20 handcrafted chambers, no parser commands

Body:

Hey everyone. I built Project Imagination because I wanted to bring text adventures to mobile without the parser friction.

No "GET LAMP" or "GO NORTH." You type what you'd actually do: "I pick up the lamp and look around" or "I ask the guard why the door is locked." The AI handles the natural language and narrates the world's response.

But -- and this was the hard design problem -- the AI doesn't control game state. Every chamber has hand-designed logic with specific solutions and multiple paths. The AI narrates the experience, it doesn't run it. This means puzzles are consistent and solvable, not randomly generated.

20 chambers in total:
- Logic puzzles (combination locks, pattern recognition)
- Social puzzles (convince an NPC, negotiate a trade)
- Moral dilemmas (sacrifice one to save many?)
- Mystery chambers (figure out who did it from clues)
- Riddles and lateral thinking challenges

Each chamber is self-contained, about 10-15 minutes to solve. The game also tracks your decisions across all chambers and builds a personality profile at the end.

Originally built for iOS, now on Android too (Flutter rewrite).

I know AI in interactive fiction is a hot topic in this community. I went with a hybrid approach specifically because I didn't want the AI making up puzzle solutions. Would love to hear your take on that tradeoff.
