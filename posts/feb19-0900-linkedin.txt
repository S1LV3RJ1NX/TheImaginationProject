You've downloaded dozens of games this year. How many made you actually think?

Not react. Not tap faster. Think.

I removed the graphics entirely. What's left is a game that only works if your imagination does.

You enter a chamber. A farmer and a merchant both accuse each other of cheating. You're the judge. You examine the cow. You count the coins. You find a witness who changes everything.

That's one chamber out of twenty.

Project Imagination is a text-based iOS game. You type what you'd do in plain English. The world responds. Every chamber tests something different about how your mind works.

Launching soon. Waitlist is open:

Would you play a game with zero graphics?
