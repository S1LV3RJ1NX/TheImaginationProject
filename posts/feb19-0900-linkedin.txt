I built a game because I was tired of how most mobile games treat people.

Flashing lights. Countdown timers. Dopamine traps designed to extract money.

I wanted the opposite.

Project Imagination is a text-based puzzle game. No graphics. No ads. No in-app purchases. No hand-holding.

You enter a chamber. You read. You think. You type what you'd do. The world responds.

20 handcrafted chambers. Riddles, mysteries, moral dilemmas, social deduction.

It's not for everyone. But if you've ever enjoyed escape rooms, D&D, or lateral thinking puzzles, I think you'd like this.

Launching soon on iOS. Waitlist is open:
