Title: I made a text-based puzzle game with zero graphics -- just launched on iOS and Android

Body:

Just launched Project Imagination. It's a text-based exploration game where you type your actions in plain English and the world responds with AI narration.

Here's the opening of one chamber:

"You stand in a circular room. Seven doors line the walls, each marked with a symbol. In the center, a pedestal holds a brass compass that spins slowly. The needle doesn't point north -- it points at you."

You type what you'd do. The game responds. Every chamber has a specific solution (or multiple paths), but the AI narration makes each playthrough feel different.

20 chambers total:
- Combination locks and pattern puzzles
- A courtroom where you're the judge
- A stranger who answers every question (but might be lying)
- A room that changes every time you look away
- Moral dilemmas with no right answer

The game also tracks how you play and builds a personality profile at the end.

No ads. No in-app purchases after the initial unlock. No hand-holding.

Happy to answer questions about the design or tech. Would love to hear feedback from anyone who tries it.
