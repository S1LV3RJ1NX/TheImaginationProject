TITLE: Show HN: A text-based puzzle game for iOS with AI narration and zero graphics

BODY (put in URL field: https://bit.ly/the-imagination-project, OR put URL in body):

I built Project Imagination — a text-based exploration game where you type actions in plain English and an AI narrates the world's response.

20 hand-designed chambers: riddles, moral dilemmas, whodunit mysteries, social deduction. Each one is self-contained (~15 min).

Tech: SwiftUI client (owns all state) + FastAPI backend (stateless LLM proxy) + HMAC-signed requests. The AI handles narration, not puzzle logic — so it can't accidentally solve things for the player.

No ads, no IAP, no tracking. Would love feedback from HN.
