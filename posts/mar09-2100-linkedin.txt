A few weeks ago I posted about a game I was building. No graphics. Just text.

Some of you signed up for the waitlist. Some of you asked: "Will it work on Android?"

The answer is now yes.

I rewrote the entire app in Flutter. Same 20 handcrafted chambers. Same AI narration. Same personality profiling. But now it runs on both iOS and Android.

Here's what the game actually looks like:

You enter a dusty room. A locked box sits on a table. Three dials on the lock. Most numbers are worn smooth, but three still have sharp edges. A faded note reads: "In order, they open the path."

You type what you'd do. The world responds.

Some chambers test logic. Others test persuasion. Others test whether you'd sacrifice one person to save five.

Submitting to both stores this week. If you want to be first in:

Would you play a game with zero graphics?
