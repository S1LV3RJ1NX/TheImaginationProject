Hey everyone! I've been working on a side project and would love to share it.

**Project Imagination** is a text-based puzzle game for iOS — no graphics at all. You enter a chamber, type what you'd do in plain English, and the world responds with AI narration.

20 handcrafted chambers — riddles, whodunit mysteries, moral dilemmas, social deduction. Each one tests a different side of how you think.

No ads. No in-app purchases. No hand-holding.

I'm running a waitlist before the App Store launch to gauge interest:

Would love feedback on the concept — and a signup if it sounds like your kind of thing!
