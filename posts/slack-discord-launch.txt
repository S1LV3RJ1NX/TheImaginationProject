Hey! Quick update: **Project Imagination** is now live on the App Store!

It's a text-based puzzle game with zero graphics. You enter a chamber, type what you'd do, and the world responds.

20 handcrafted chambers. Riddles, mysteries, moral dilemmas. No ads, no in-app purchases.

Would mean a lot if you checked it out:

Happy to answer any questions about how it's built (Swift + FastAPI + LLM narration) if anyone's curious.

NOTE: Replace [APP STORE LINK] with your actual App Store URL.
