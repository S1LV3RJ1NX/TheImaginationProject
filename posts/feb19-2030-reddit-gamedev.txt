TITLE: I spent months building a game with zero graphics - here's what I learned

BODY:

Project Imagination is a text-based puzzle game for iOS. No sprites, no 3D, no pixel art. Just text and AI narration.

Things I learned:
1. Writing is harder than coding. Designing 20 unique puzzle chambers took longer than the entire codebase
2. Playtesting text games is brutal. You can't watch someone struggle, you have to read their transcript
3. AI narration is powerful but needs guardrails. Without strict game logic, the AI would "solve" puzzles for players
4. People are skeptical of "no graphics" until they try it

Launching on iOS soon. Waitlist:

Would love to hear from anyone who's worked on text-based or narrative games. What were your biggest challenges?
