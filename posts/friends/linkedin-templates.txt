TEMPLATE A: Professional / Supportive:

A friend of mine just built something genuinely different in the mobile gaming space.

Project Imagination is a text-based puzzle game. No graphics, no ads, no in-app purchases. You explore chambers by typing what you'd do in plain English. The game responds with AI-powered narration.

20 handcrafted puzzles: riddles, mysteries, moral dilemmas, social deduction.

It also builds a personality profile based on your decisions. How you think under pressure, whether you're methodical or impulsive.

It's available on both iOS and Android:

TEMPLATE B: Shorter / Casual:

Came across something interesting. A friend built a game with literally zero graphics.

It's all text-based. You type what you'd do, and the world responds. Think D&D meets escape rooms.

No ads. No in-app purchases. 20 handcrafted chambers.

Available on both App Store and Play Store: https://bit.ly/the-imagination-project

TEMPLATE C: The Question Hook:

Would you play a game with no graphics?

No sprites, no 3D, no pixel art. Just text.

A friend built exactly that. Project Imagination. You enter chambers, type what you'd do, and the world responds. It even builds a personality profile based on your choices.

I thought it was weird at first. Then I tried it.
