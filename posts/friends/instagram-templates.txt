CAPTION:

A friend of mine built something really different. A puzzle game with no graphics.

You enter a chamber, type what you'd do in plain English, and the world responds.
Riddles, mysteries, moral dilemmas. 20 handcrafted chambers.

No ads. No in-app purchases. Just your brain.

It's called Project Imagination and it's launching soon on iOS.
