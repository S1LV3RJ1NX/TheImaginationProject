I've been working on something different.

Project Imagination is a text-based iOS game with no graphics, no ads, and no in-app purchases.

You enter a chamber. You type what you'd do. The world responds.

Some puzzles test logic. Others test moral judgment, persuasion, or patience.

The interesting part: the game tracks your decisions and builds a personality profile — are you methodical or intuitive? Patient or impulsive?

It's D&D exploration meets escape rooms, powered by AI narration.

I'm launching on the App Store soon and running a waitlist to gauge interest:

Would love your thoughts — or a signup if it sounds like your kind of thing.
