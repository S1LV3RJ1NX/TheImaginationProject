CAPTION:

A farmer says the merchant sold him a sick cow.
The merchant says the farmer paid five coins short.

You're the judge. Who's lying?

You examine the cow. You count the coins. You find a witness.

The answer isn't what you expect.

That's one chamber. There are nineteen more.

VISUAL IDEA: Green monospace text on black background: "A farmer and a merchant both say the other cheated. You're the judge. What do you do?"
