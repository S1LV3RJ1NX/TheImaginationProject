Hey, been working on something for a while.

Picture this: you walk into a room. There's a locked box on a pedestal. The lock has three dials. You look closer and notice most numbers are worn smooth, but three still have sharp edges.

You type "examine the note." A faded parchment reads: "In order, they open the path."

That's how the whole game works. No graphics. You type what you'd do. The world responds.

20 chambers, each one different. It's almost ready.
