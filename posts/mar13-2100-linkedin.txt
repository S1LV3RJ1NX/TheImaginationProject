Most mobile games are designed to waste your time. Countdown timers. Dopamine traps. Flashing lights engineered to extract money.

I built the opposite.

Project Imagination is a text-based puzzle game. No graphics. No ads. No in-app purchases. No hand-holding.

You enter a chamber. You read. You think. You type what you'd do. The world responds.

20 handcrafted chambers. Each one tests a different part of how your mind works -- logic, empathy, persuasion, patience, moral reasoning.

At the end, the game builds a personality profile based on your actual decisions. Not a quiz. Not multiple choice. Just how you behaved when you didn't know you were being measured.

Submitted to both the App Store and Google Play. Launching any day now.
