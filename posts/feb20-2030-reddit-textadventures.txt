TITLE: Built a modern text adventure for iOS — 20 handcrafted chambers, AI narration, no parser commands

BODY:

Hey everyone. Long-time text adventure fan here. I built Project Imagination because I wanted to bring the genre to mobile in a way that feels modern — no parser commands, just type what you'd actually do in plain English.

Each chamber is a self-contained puzzle: some test logic, some test moral judgment, some test persuasion. The AI handles narration and responds to your natural language input.

It's not procedurally generated — every chamber is hand-designed with specific solutions and multiple paths.

Launching soon on iOS. I'm collecting waitlist signups to gauge interest: https://bit.ly/the-imagination-project

Curious what this community thinks. Any concerns about AI narration in interactive fiction? I'd love the feedback.
