Hey! I'm launching an iOS app called Project Imagination, a text-based puzzle game where you type what you'd do, and the world responds. Think D&D meets escape rooms.

I'm building a waitlist before launch. Would mean a lot if you could check it out and sign up:

And if you know anyone who'd be into this kind of thing, please forward!
