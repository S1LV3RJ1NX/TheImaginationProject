TITLE: I made a text-based puzzle game with zero graphics - just your words and your mind

BODY:

I've been working on Project Imagination for the past few months. It's a text-based exploration game for iOS where you type your actions in plain English and the world responds with AI narration.

20 handcrafted chambers. Riddles, whodunit mysteries, moral dilemmas, social persuasion puzzles.

No ads, no in-app purchases, no hand-holding.

I'm running a waitlist before the App Store launch:

Would love to hear what you think of the concept. Happy to answer any questions about how it works under the hood.
