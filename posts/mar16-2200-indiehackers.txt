Title: I'm a solo dev launching a text-based puzzle game with zero graphics on both iOS and Android

Body:

I've been building Project Imagination for the past few months. It's a text-based exploration game where you type your actions in plain English and the world responds with AI narration.

The pitch: 20 handcrafted puzzle chambers. No graphics. No ads. One-time $2.99 purchase.

Each chamber tests a different kind of thinking -- logic, persuasion, moral reasoning, pattern recognition, lateral thinking. The game tracks your decisions and builds a personality profile at the end.

The build:
- Started in native Swift (iOS only)
- Realized most of my testers had Android
- Rewrote in Flutter to ship both platforms from one codebase
- Backend is a stateless FastAPI server that proxies LLM calls
- Game logic runs entirely on the client
- Total backend cost per player session: ~$0.005

Monetization: one-time IAP to unlock all chambers. No subscription, no ads, no data selling.

The bet: there's a market for people who want a puzzle game that respects their intelligence and their time. No flashing lights, no energy timers, no dark patterns. Just puzzles.

Would love feedback from this community. Anyone else building in the "premium mobile game" space?
