REEL IDEA (15-30 seconds):

1. Screen record yourself playing a chamber (blur or crop to avoid spoilers)
2. Add text overlay narrating the experience:
   - "Enter the chamber..."
   - "Read the inscription..."
   - "What do you do?"
   - [Show you typing a command]
   - "The world responds."
3. End card: "Project Imagination — coming soon. Link in bio."
4. Use trending audio (low-key, mysterious vibe)

CAPTION:
No graphics. Just text. Just your mind. Coming soon to iOS.
