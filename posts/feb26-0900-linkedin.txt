[X] people have joined the waitlist for Project Imagination in [Y] days.

For a game with no graphics, no marketing budget, and no VC funding, that feels like validation.

Thank you to everyone who signed up and shared it.

If you missed it: Project Imagination is a text-based iOS puzzle game where you explore chambers using only your words. Think escape rooms meets D&D.
