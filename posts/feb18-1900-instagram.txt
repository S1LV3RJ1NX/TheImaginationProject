CAPTION:

You enter a chamber. You don't know what's inside.

You look around. A stone pedestal. A locked box. Three dials.

You type what you'd do. The world responds.

No graphics. No menus. Just your words and your mind.

Coming soon to iOS.

VISUAL IDEA: Black background, green monospace text that reads "You enter a chamber. You don't know what's inside. What do you do?"
