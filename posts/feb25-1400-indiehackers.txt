TITLE: Building a text-based iOS puzzle game with zero graphics

BODY:

I'm a solo dev building Project Imagination — a text-based exploration game where you type your actions and the world responds with AI narration.

- 20 handcrafted chambers (riddles, mysteries, moral dilemmas)
- No ads, no IAP
- SwiftUI + FastAPI + LLM narration
- Pre-launch waitlist: https://bit.ly/the-imagination-project

Currently running a waitlist to gauge interest before the App Store launch. Would love feedback from this community.
