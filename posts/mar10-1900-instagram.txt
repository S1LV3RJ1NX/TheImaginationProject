CAPTION:

A locked room. A stranger who answers every question. An inscription that reads "only the truthful may pass."

You don't know if the stranger is lying.

What do you do?

That's one of 20 chambers in Project Imagination. No graphics. No hand-holding. Just your words against the puzzle.

Coming this week to both iOS and Android. Link in bio.
