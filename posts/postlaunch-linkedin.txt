Project Imagination launched yesterday.

A few things surprised me.

The chamber most people get stuck on isn't the hardest one. It's the one that requires patience. Most players try to force the solution in 3 moves. The actual solution takes 8.

The personality profiles are polarizing. Some players love seeing their archetype. Others are uncomfortable with how accurately it reads them. One tester said "I don't like that a game knows I avoid confrontation."

And the question I keep getting: "Why no graphics?"

Because your imagination is better than anything I could render. Two people play the same chamber and see completely different worlds. That's the point.
