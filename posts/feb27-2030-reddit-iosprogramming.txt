TITLE: I built an AI-powered text adventure game for iOS — here's the architecture

BODY:

Just finished building Project Imagination — a text-based puzzle game where the narration is handled by an LLM, but the game logic and state is entirely client-side.

Architecture:
- Swift/SwiftUI on the client, owns all game state
- FastAPI backend acts as a stateless LLM proxy
- HMAC-signed requests for API security
- Each "chamber" has hand-designed logic with specific solutions
- The AI handles narration/response, not puzzle generation

The interesting challenge was making AI narration feel consistent without giving the AI control over puzzle state. Happy to go deeper on any of these if anyone's curious.
