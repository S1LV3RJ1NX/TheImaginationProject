Just submitted Project Imagination to the App Store.

Here's the thing nobody expects: the most engaging chamber in the game has no visuals, no sound effects, and no animation.

It has a farmer, a merchant, and a dispute over a sick cow.

You're the judge. You examine evidence. You question witnesses. You make a ruling. And the game quietly tracks whether you rushed to judgment or investigated first.

That's what happens when you strip away everything except the player's mind. The game becomes a mirror.

20 chambers. Each one tests a different part of how you think. Logic. Empathy. Patience. Persuasion.

No ads. No in-app purchases. Just text and your imagination.
