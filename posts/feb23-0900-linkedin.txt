I built a game that reveals how you think.

It doesn't ask you multiple-choice questions. Instead, it drops you into 20 different scenarios — and watches what you do.

Do you examine every detail before acting, or jump in?
Do you negotiate, or demand?
Do you follow the rules, or find a loophole?

Every chamber in Project Imagination is a different puzzle. And every puzzle reveals a different side of you.

Coming soon to iOS. Join the waitlist to be first:

What do you think — would you play a game with zero graphics?
