## YOUR OWN POSTS

### Post 1 — Teaser (no details, build curiosity)

**Caption:**
```
What if a game had zero graphics?

No sprites. No 3D renders. No pixel art.

Just text. Just your words. Just your mind.

Coming soon.

```

**Visual idea:** Black background, white/green monospace text that reads "What do you do?" — simple, on-brand.

### Post 2 — Reveal (pair with screenshot or landing page hero)

**Caption:**
```
No graphics. No noise. Just your words and your mind.

I've been building a text-based exploration game where you type your actions in plain English and the world responds.

20 handcrafted chambers. Riddles. Mysteries. Moral dilemmas. No ads. No in-app purchases.

The App Store launch is coming soon — join the waitlist to be first in (link in bio).

**Visual idea:** Screenshot of the app, or a collage of 3-4 screenshots in a carousel.

### Post 3 — The Hook (personality angle)

**Caption:**
```
I built a game that tells you how you think.

Every choice you make inside the chambers is tracked.
Are you methodical or impulsive?
Logical or empathetic?
Patient or reckless?

20 chambers. Each one different. Each one reveals something about you.

Project Imagination — coming soon to iOS.

### Post 4 — The Quote (shareable / viral potential)

**Caption:**
```
Your phone has more processing power than the computers that sent humans to the moon.

Stop wasting it on candy-colored slot machines.

Use your imagination.

## STORY / CAROUSEL IDEAS

### Story Sequence (5-6 frames)

- Frame 1: "What if a game had zero graphics?"
- Frame 2: "No sprites. No 3D. Just text."
- Frame 3: "You type what you'd do. The world responds."
- Frame 4: "20 chambers. Each one different."
- Frame 5: [Screenshot of gameplay]
- Frame 6: "Join the waitlist — link in bio" + link sticker

### Reels Idea

Screen-record yourself playing a chamber (blur parts to avoid spoilers). Add text overlay narrating the experience. 15-30 seconds, trending audio. End with "Link in bio".
