## YOUR OWN POSTS

### Post 1 — Launch Announcement / Building in Public

```
I've been working on something different.

Project Imagination is a text-based iOS game with no graphics, no ads, and no in-app purchases.

You enter a chamber. You type what you'd do. The world responds.

Some puzzles test logic. Others test moral judgment, persuasion, or patience.

The interesting part: the game tracks your decisions and builds a personality profile — are you methodical or intuitive? Patient or impulsive?

It's D&D exploration meets escape rooms, powered by AI narration.

I'm launching on the App Store soon and running a waitlist to gauge interest:

Would love your thoughts — or a signup if it sounds like your kind of thing.

### Post 2 — The "Why I Built This" Story

```
I built a game because I was tired of how most mobile games treat people.

Flashing lights. Countdown timers. Dopamine traps designed to extract money.

I wanted the opposite.

Project Imagination is a text-based puzzle game. No graphics. No ads. No in-app purchases. No hand-holding.

You enter a chamber. You read. You think. You type what you'd do. The world responds.

20 handcrafted chambers — riddles, mysteries, moral dilemmas, social deduction.

It's not for everyone. But if you've ever enjoyed escape rooms, D&D, or lateral thinking puzzles — I think you'd like this.

Launching soon on iOS. Waitlist is open:

### Post 3 — The Personality Angle (high engagement potential)

```
I built a game that reveals how you think.

It doesn't ask you multiple-choice questions. Instead, it drops you into 20 different scenarios — and watches what you do.

Do you examine every detail before acting, or jump in?
Do you negotiate, or demand?
Do you follow the rules, or find a loophole?

Every chamber in Project Imagination is a different puzzle. And every puzzle reveals a different side of you.

Coming soon to iOS. Join the waitlist to be first:

What do you think — would you play a game with zero graphics?

## TEMPLATES FOR CONNECTIONS TO SHARE

### Template A — Professional / Supportive

```
A friend of mine just built something genuinely different in the mobile gaming space.

Project Imagination is a text-based puzzle game — no graphics, no ads, no in-app purchases. You explore chambers by typing what you'd do in plain English. The game responds with AI-powered narration.

20 handcrafted puzzles: riddles, mysteries, moral dilemmas, social deduction.

It also builds a personality profile based on your decisions — how you think under pressure, whether you're methodical or impulsive.

It's launching soon on iOS. If this sounds like your kind of thing:

### Template B — Shorter / Casual

```
Came across something interesting — a friend built an iOS game with literally zero graphics.

It's all text-based. You type what you'd do, and the world responds. Think D&D meets escape rooms.

No ads. No in-app purchases. 20 handcrafted chambers.

Launching soon, waitlist is open: https://bit.ly/the-imagination-project

### Template C — The Question Hook (drives comments)

```
Would you play a game with no graphics?

No sprites, no 3D, no pixel art. Just text.

A friend built exactly that — Project Imagination. You enter chambers, type what you'd do, and the world responds. It even builds a personality profile based on your choices.

I thought it was weird at first. Then I tried it.
