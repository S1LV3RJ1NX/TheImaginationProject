## FEBRUARY (COMPLETED / PAUSED)

Posts made in Feb (teaser phase — these set up the March callback):

All remaining Feb posts are **cancelled**. Marketing resumes in March with both iOS and Android ready.

## PRE-LAUNCH REELS (Feb 20 - Mar 8)

Casual, unpolished dev Reels during the Flutter port. No editing required. Phone propped up filming your screen, 15-30 seconds, text overlay telling the story. Post whenever something interesting happens -- no fixed schedule.

**Reel 1 (Week 1 of port):** "Rewriting my entire app because my friends have Android"
- Film: your screen with the Flutter project being created, terminal scrolling
- Text overlay: "Built an iOS app. Most of my friends have Android. So I'm rewriting the whole thing in Flutter."
- End card: "Follow for the journey"
- Audio: trending lo-fi or chill beat

**Reel 2 (Week 1-2):** "11,000 lines of Swift. Zero lines of Dart. Let's go."
- Film: split screen -- Xcode on left, VS Code/Cursor on right. Swift file on one side, empty Dart file on the other.
- Time-lapse of code appearing on the Dart side.
- Text overlay: the line count changing (11,000 -> 8,000 -> 5,000 -> done)

**Reel 3 (Week 2):** "The moment it ran on Android for the first time"
- Film: Android emulator booting the app. The dark terminal UI appearing.
- Genuine reaction optional. Keep it real.
- Text overlay: "3 years of iPhone. First time seeing my app on Android."
- This one has viral potential -- the "first time" moment is universally relatable.

**Reel 4 (Week 2-3):** "A game with zero graphics. Here's what it looks like."
- Screen record an actual chamber being played. Show the SSE text streaming in real-time.
- Blur or cut before any spoilers.
- Text overlay: "You type what you'd do. The world responds."
- End card: "Launching soon. Link in bio."

**Reel 5 (Week 3, pre-launch):** "Same app. Two phones."
- Film: iPhone and Android side by side, both running the app, both showing the same chamber.
- Text overlay: "Built it once. Runs everywhere."
- This is the payoff Reel -- shows the Flutter port worked.

**Tips for dev Reels:**
- Raw > polished. Desk, coffee, terminal. Not a studio.
- Hook in the first 1-2 seconds (text overlay + movement)
- Use trending audio but keep it quiet -- the visual is the story
- Hashtags: #buildinpublic #indiedev #gamedev #flutter #mobilegaming
- Post between 7-8 PM IST for Indian audience reach
- Cross-post as TikTok if you have an account (same content works)

## QUICK RULES

- Never post on 2+ platforms at the exact same time — stagger by 30-60 min
- LinkedIn: max 1 post/day
- Reddit: max 1 post per subreddit, spaced across days, never cross-post same text
- WhatsApp statuses expire in 24h — post evenings
- Instagram: stories daily, feed posts every 2-3 days
- Engage with every comment/reply within 2 hours — boosts algorithmic reach
- Screenshot your waitlist counter at milestones (50, 100, 200, 500) for social proof posts
- **Indian audience (WhatsApp, Instagram): 7:00-8:00 PM IST**
- **Western audience (LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit, HN): 9:00-10:30 PM IST**

## REDDIT RULES

Reddit hates self-promotion. But Reddit loves indie devs who are genuine, share their process, and contribute before asking.

- **Contribute first, promote never (directly)** — don't post "check out my game." Post something genuinely interesting and let people discover your game in the comments or your profile.
- **Use "Show HN" style framing** — "I made this, here's what I learned" not "download my app."
- **Read each sub's rules** — some have specific self-promo days, some ban links entirely.
- **Max 1 post per subreddit**, spaced across days, never cross-post the same text.

Target subreddits: r/gamedev (~1.5M), r/puzzles (~800k), r/indiegaming (~700k), r/textadventures (~15k), r/InteractiveFiction (~20k), r/iOSProgramming (~200k)

## REACHING BEYOND YOUR NETWORK

### LinkedIn — Escape the bubble
- **Comment on others' posts BEFORE you post** — spend 10 min engaging on 5-10 posts in #GameDev, #BuildInPublic, #IndieGames feeds. LinkedIn rewards active users with more reach.
- **End every post with a question** — "Would you play a game with zero graphics?" drives comments, and comments = reach.
- **Reply to every comment within 2 hours** — this is the single biggest LinkedIn algorithm signal.
- **Use 3-5 hashtags** in PascalCase at the end. Mix big reach tags (#Innovation, #AI) with niche (#IndieGames, #BuildInPublic).
- **Tag no one unless they're genuinely relevant** — LinkedIn penalizes engagement-bait tagging.

### Twitter/X — Get into the conversation
- **Quote-tweet relevant threads** — search for "indie game", "text adventure", "mobile gaming" and add your take with your link. This puts you in front of THEIR audience.
- **Reply to big accounts** in the indie dev space (search for popular #gamedev posters) — genuine replies get profile clicks.
- **Use day-specific community hashtags**: #WishlistWednesday, #WIPWednesday, #MarketingMonday, #ScreenshotSaturday — these have active communities that browse the tag.
- **Use 2-4 hashtags max** — more looks spammy on Twitter.
- **Pin your best tweet** — anyone who visits your profile sees it first.
- **Thread format works** — Turn your longer posts into 3-4 tweet threads. Threads get 2-3x the reach of single tweets.

### Both platforms
- **First 30-60 minutes are critical** — the algorithm decides reach based on early engagement. Be online and reply to every interaction.
- **Post consistently for 2 weeks** — algorithms reward regular posters. Random one-off posts get buried.
- **Cross-pollinate** — share your LinkedIn post link on Twitter and vice versa. Different audiences on each.
