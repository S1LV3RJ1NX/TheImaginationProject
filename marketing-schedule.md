## QUICK RULES

- Never post on 2+ platforms at the exact same time — stagger by 30-60 min
- LinkedIn: max 1 post/day
- Reddit: max 1 post per subreddit, spaced across days, never cross-post same text
- WhatsApp statuses expire in 24h — post evenings
- Instagram: stories daily, feed posts every 2-3 days
- Engage with every comment/reply within 2 hours — boosts algorithmic reach
- Screenshot your waitlist counter at milestones (50, 100, 200, 500) for social proof posts
- **Indian audience (WhatsApp, Instagram): 7:00-8:00 PM IST**
- **Western audience (LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit, HN): 9:00-10:30 PM IST**

## REACHING BEYOND YOUR NETWORK

### LinkedIn — Escape the bubble
- **Comment on others' posts BEFORE you post** — spend 10 min engaging on 5-10 posts in #GameDev, #BuildInPublic, #IndieGames feeds. LinkedIn rewards active users with more reach.
- **End every post with a question** — "Would you play a game with zero graphics?" drives comments, and comments = reach.
- **Reply to every comment within 2 hours** — this is the single biggest LinkedIn algorithm signal.
- **Use 3-5 hashtags** in PascalCase at the end. Mix big reach tags (#Innovation, #AI) with niche (#IndieGames, #BuildInPublic).
- **Tag no one unless they're genuinely relevant** — LinkedIn penalizes engagement-bait tagging.

### Twitter/X — Get into the conversation
- **Quote-tweet relevant threads** — search for "indie game", "text adventure", "mobile gaming" and add your take with your link. This puts you in front of THEIR audience.
- **Reply to big accounts** in the indie dev space (search for popular #gamedev posters) — genuine replies get profile clicks.
- **Use day-specific community hashtags**: #WishlistWednesday, #WIPWednesday, #MarketingMonday, #ScreenshotSaturday — these have active communities that browse the tag.
- **Use 2-4 hashtags max** — more looks spammy on Twitter.
- **Pin your best tweet** — anyone who visits your profile sees it first.
- **Thread format works** — Turn your longer posts into 3-4 tweet threads. Threads get 2-3x the reach of single tweets.

### Both platforms
- **First 30-60 minutes are critical** — the algorithm decides reach based on early engagement. Be online and reply to every interaction.
- **Post consistently for 2 weeks** — algorithms reward regular posters. Random one-off posts get buried.
- **Cross-pollinate** — share your LinkedIn post link on Twitter and vice versa. Different audiences on each.
