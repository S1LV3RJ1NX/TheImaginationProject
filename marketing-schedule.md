## QUICK RULES

- **Never post on more than 2 platforms at the same time** — stagger by at least 1-2 hours
- **Don't post more than once per day on LinkedIn** — the algorithm punishes rapid posting
- **Reddit: max 1 post per subreddit.** Space them across different days. Never cross-post the same text.
- **WhatsApp statuses expire in 24h** — post in the evening when people check
- **Instagram: stories daily, feed posts every 2-3 days** — don't flood
- **Engage with every comment/reply** on all platforms within the first 2 hours — this boosts algorithmic reach
- **Screenshot your waitlist counter** at milestones (50, 100, 200, 500) — use as social proof content
